    <h2>Welcome to the Homeless Student Fund</h2>
	There is currently a huge amount of homeless students with a disprorportionate amount who are people of color, LGBTQ, and people coming from dysfunctional homes.
	Many of these students suffer from traumatic experiences, lack of community support, and social obstacles.
	Nonetheless, against all odds, these individuals have chosen to follow their dreams and join the college community. Just that amount of guts is commendable and inspiring!
	Imagine that: following a dream; attempt to heal your trauma; gain community support; tackle your obstacles: when everyone around you thought you would fail through education!
	Unfortunately, these same intrepid, modern-day pioneers towards self-worth have an extremely difficult time during this transitional period:
	Lack of good advice keeps them from holding down a job, paying for rent, and making end's meet.
	Moreover, lack of support from a community and family compounds their anxiety, depression and senes of hopelessness.
	Sadly, financial aid does not help these homeless students at the root of the problem; they only provide topical remedies: band-aids that are inadequate at best, counterproductive at worst.
	By establishing this Homeless Student Fund, we hope to address the issues and problems which financial aid is unwilling to address and thereby solve the problem at the source.
	How can you help out? We're so glad you're interested in helping out!</p>
