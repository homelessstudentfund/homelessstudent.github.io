    <h2>Ideas on Helping Sex Workers Become Erotic Artists</h2> 
	<p>Your customized drawing is coming soon.</p>
	<p>I appreciate your thoughs on decriminalizing sex work; yet I believe that a sex worker is better off using his/her sensuality to create art; he or she is better off being an erotic artist.</p>
    <p>Sex work should be decriminalized: punishing a sex worker is tantamount to punishing an obese person for eating too much sugary foods.</p>
	<p>However, decriminalizing sex work does not help the sex worker's emotional health; just as decriminalizing drugs does not help the drug addict's emotional health..</p>
	<p>As human beings, we are healthier when we say "no" to money and "yes" to art.</p>
	<p>Art is essential to healing emotional, spiritual and psychological damage.</p>
	<p>Because art can heal the human spirit, helping a sex worker, drug addict or traumatized individual create art is beneficial to that individual and to society at large.</p>
	<p>Healing, nonetheless, is a continual, never-ending process; Jungian psychology can help us use art to become integrated individuals.</p>
	<p>Individuation can help a sex worker become an erotic artist; the Erotic Artist can use his or her gifts for sensuality to create works of art that help him or her heal and become healthy.</p>

	<h2><u>ANIMA</u></h2>
	<p>EXT. STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - DAY</p>
	<p>We see an inner city bustle, cars blaring rap, Spanish music and people yelling. The camera focuses on a muscled, swarthy man with a neat fade, jeans and a football jersey.</p> 
	<p>SHADOW</p>
	<p>Shoot my cut, big dog. I'm gone. I have to get to Ventura..</p>
	<p>GUZZLER</p>
	<p>Damn, what you gonna do way over there, Shade?.</p>
	<p>SHADOW</p>
	<p>Special delivery, homie. Don't even trip.</p>
	<p>Shadow gets into a 1978 Plymouth Fury. We see him get on the 110 Freeway, transfer to the 105 Freeway, and he takes the Long Beach Boulevard offramp.</p>
	<p>INT. SMALL ROOM WITH MEAGER FURNISHINGS</p>
	<p>A woman with long black hair is coloring a mandala coloring page. She has a cinnamon-colored complexion and harsh but attractive facial features.</p>
	<p>SHADOW</p>
	<p>Negra!</p>
	<p>ANIMA</p>
	<p>Mande!</p>
	<p>SHADOW</p>
	<p>Get your ass out here!</p>
	<p>ANIMA</p>
	<p>Ay voy!</p>
	<p>Anima gets into the passenger side of the Plymouth Fury.</p> 
	<p>We see Shadow getting back on the 105 Freeway, merging onto the 405 Freeway, and finally onto the 101 Freeway towards Ventura. He gets off near Camarillo.</p>
	<p>We see Shadow and Anima arguing in the Plymouth Fury.</p>
	<p>SHADOW</p>
	<p>I said turn the fuckin shit off, you ungrateful stupid bitch!</p>
	<p>We get a close up of Anima's face as Shadow pulls her hair back. The expression on her face is more hurt than scared. She turns off her smart phone.</p>
	<p>Anima seems dejected as Shadow continues to berate her. He turns off the engine of the Plymouth Fury.</p>
	<p>ANIMA<p>
	<p>Gangster. Ha! Yeah right. What kind of gangster? Go fuck yourself!<p>
	<p>Anima jumps out of the car and runs for some trees to hide.<p>
	<p>SHADOW</p>
	<p>Negra! Get your fuckin ass over here! Negrita! I'm sorry, Negrita. Get back in the car. We're too far from the pad!</p>
	<p>We see Anima running through a backyard towards a glass door. She tries the door handle, and it's open. She walks inside and hides under a bed.</p>
	<p>We get a close up of her face in the darkness under the bed. She no longer has a dejected look on her face. She has a smirk, and a cool look of strength and power.</p>
	<p>We see a little boy walk into the room and turn on Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote cartoons on the television. He's sitting in front of the television set near Anima.</p>
	<p>Anima looks annoyed under the bed.</p>
	<p>Anima grabs the little boy by the hair, half of her body still under the bed. She imitates shadow.</p>
	<p>ANIMA</p>
	<p>Turn that shit off, you stupid ungrateful little bitch!</p>
	<p>The little boy looks terrified. She is the spit image of Shadow in rage and hate.</p>
	<p>Anima violently shoves the little boy by the hair in the direction of the television set. The little boy turns off the television and stares in terror at Anima.</p>
	<p>Anima crawls out from under the bed; She coolly walks out of the room through the glass door she used to enter. The little boy gets up and walks as if in a daze towards the living room.</p>
	<p>We see a young woman sitting on a sofa. The little boy walks up to her.</p>
	<p>NIMO</p>
	<p>There's a black lady under the bed telling me to turn off the TV.</p>
	<p>OLDER SISTER</p>
	<p>So she told you to turn off the TV?</p>
	<p>NIMO</p>
	<p>Yeah.</p>
	<p>OLDER SISTER</p>
	<p>Which way did she go?</p>
	<p>Nimo points to the glass door.</p>
	<p>NIMO</p>
	<p>She walked out.</p>
